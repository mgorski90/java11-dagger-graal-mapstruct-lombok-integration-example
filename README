Just playing with native compilation of simple JDK11 application to native application (Linux / ELF64). Testing integration of
Google Dagger 2 DI container together with Lombok and MapStruct. No reflection is used.

Requires JAVA_HOME to be set on graalvm-ce-java11-20.0.0 to make a native compilation work.
$ mvn clean package -P native
For standard HotSpot just don't use native profile.
$ mvn clean package

Stub for more sophisticated use cases in the future.
